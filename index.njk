  I am currently a PhD student at the <a href="https://ischool.uw.edu/">University of Washington Information School</a> working in the <a href="https://datalab.ischool.uw.edu/">UW DataLab</a>. My work focuses on public interest technology, the use of government data, and open-source software. I aim to be an applied researcher, producing software and knowledge that benefit the public through building large-scale data access systems that encourage civic participation.
</p>

<p>
  I currently lead a team of developers and designers as we work on <a href="https://councildataproject.github.io/">CouncilDataProject</a> -- an easily deployable, generalizable system for municipal government event data processing, archival, search, and, discovery in the hopes of better local government accessibility and accountability. Council Data Project infrastructure is entirely free! We hope to see it utilized by all members of the public for increased municipal government awareness and for shared, collaborative, open access research on municipal governance behaviors.
