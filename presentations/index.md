#### Science of Scientific Software

##### Panel: An Evening of Open: Science, Software, and AI

_GitHub, UC Law San Francisco, Open Forum for AI, and SF French Consulate Office of Science and Technology - 23 October 2025_

_For decades, the open source and open access movements have transformed how knowledge is created, shared, and applied — from the earliest collaborative code repositories and freely available research to today’s global networks driving open science and AI innovation. An Evening of Open: Science, Software, and AI—co‑hosted by GitHub, UC Law SF, Open Forum for AI, and the SF French Consulate Office of Science and Technology during International Open Access Week and Open Source AI Week—honors this rich legacy and brings together researchers, technologists, and policymakers to celebrate how open source software, open science, and open source AI work together to accelerate discovery and innovation._

#### Public Interest Technology

##### Guest Lecture: Council Data Project and Computational Building Blocks for Municipal Political Scholarship

_Brian Keegan's (CU Boulder) Information Expostion - 23 February 2023_

_A intro for undergraduate students as to why municipal legislative data is hard to find, parse, and process and some of the techniques Council Data Project is using to do so._

##### Council Data Project and Centralization in Civic Technology Projects

_Open Oakland - 8 February 2022_

_Council Data Project builds tools for municipal government accessibility and transparency. CDP’s tools gather meeting info, generate transcripts, archive all meeting documents, presentations, reports, and make all of these items accessible from their web application, allowing users to link directly to points in a meeting, track the legislative history of a bill, see full voting records, and more. All of CDP’s tools are easily deployable and any contributions help everyone else -- a new feature to the frontend codebase is a new feature made available to every CDP deployment._

#### Computational Biology

##### AICSImageIO and Large Microscopy Dataset Processing

_Dask Summit - 2021_

_How does AICSImageIO attempt to solve problems in image reading and "good" metadata utilzation throughout the computation process. How does it attempt to also solve problems in scaling image analysis to tens-of-thousands images per dataset. This talk will give a brief overview of AICSImageIO in general and then provides a specific example of where it speeds up image processing and encourages users to use metadata as a code legibility tool._
